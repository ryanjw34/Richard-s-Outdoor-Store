<p1>      We are  Richard’s Outdoor Store, founded only 5 years ago in 2015 and has established a strong presence in the outdoor stores market. <br>
    <br>
    Our company was founded by Richard after working at an army-surplus store in New York state where Richard dreamed of one day becoming a park ranger but after his experience working in the army-surplus store realized that the market was still wide open for new competitors to enter the field of outdoor equipment and merchandise. <br>
    <br>
    With not much to his name, Richard opened up the first store as a specialized store for hiking equipment and clothing, but it soon flourished into the succesful business now running today
    <br>
    <br>
    Richard’s may have only been in the market for 5 years now, but the company already has expanded to owning more than 30 stores across New York state and soon we plan to expand across the New England area. We Hope you enjoy your time shopping with us and quality will always be a guarantee, afterall Richard is the Best, Forget the Rest!
